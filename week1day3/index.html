    <p>I have 12 management experience and I worked and lived in China for 12 years.  I left the US after Katrina in 2005.  Since my return form China I have been visiting family, doing gig work like uber and doordash.  I tried a few management positions around the area and the work satisfaction and income was not what I wanted.  I have always done and enjoyed programming and I have decided to make a career change.</p>
